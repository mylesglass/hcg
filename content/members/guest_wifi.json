  "markdown": "We've decided to offer wifi for free to our customers. We want you to be able to work on what you need to while your children are within our gymnasium. \n\nWe ask that in return you help support our fundraising efforts, and if you are feeling generous drop a couple coins into our donation bucket near that office.\n\n## What took you so long?\n\nOur location is a bit of a unique one. Our current situation is that Internet providers aren't really interested in putting in the sufficient hardware to support a fast connection, or even a stable one. For the moment we run on a data plan similar to what you might have on your mobile phone, but designed for businesses. It has it's a usage limit, and we have to strictly abide by that.\n\n## What's the limit?\n\nDevices can use up to X MB per day. There is a global cap of 100 GB per month. This is because we are on a fixed amount and cannot get an unlimited plan in our current location. Please be considerate and only use what you need.\n\n## What traffic is restricted/banned?\n\nVideo streaming is limited to XXXkbps, this should still allow you to watch video, but it might not be a full definition. We've currently got blocks on any sort of peer-to-peer traffic like BitTorrent. Not a judgement, just something you need to do on your own connection. Devices have a daily quota, please be reasonable."
