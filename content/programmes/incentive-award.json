  "body": "EXCEL is a 6-level programme created by Harbour City Gymnastics for recreational gymnasts.\n\nWe currently offer this programme for artistic gymnastics, which covers both women’s and men’s apparatus i.e. Vault, Bars, Beam, Floor, Pommel, Rings.\n\nThere is a high emphasis on teaching technique that is both aesthetically pleasing and that will develop later towards more difficult skills. Compared to our entry-level recreational classes (Ribbon & Badge), gymnasts will find that they are spending more class time working in small groups with a coach to learn new skills.\n\n## Assessment\n\nGymnasts are judged to verify that they are performing their set skills to a certain level, before being able to move upwards into the next level. Testing happens throughout the year on specific testing days, and also at competitions (see below).\n\n## Competitions\n\nGymnasts in EXCEL are offered the opportunity to compete in Gym-For-All competitions during the year. Routines are developed within the class for these competitions, and supplementary sessions are allocated to allow the gymnasts to prepare.",
