  "body": "The Incentive Award programme is designed Gymnastics New Zealand, and offers awards in 4 different codes; Artistic, Trampoline, Rhythmic, and Aerobics. Harbour City GymSports currently offers Artistic Incentive Awards for levels 1 – 7.\r\n\nGymnasts work in small focused groups towards achieving skills and routines required by their level. Gymnasts 6 years and over gain entry to these classes by coach selection, and have generally participated in our Ribbon or Badge award programmes.\n\n## Assessment\n\nAwards are gained through a testing process where gymnasts are examined by qualified GNZ judges. Classes will be offered testing twice yearly within the Club. Testing is carried out either on a special testing day, or during normal class time. Preparation for testing involves:\n\n* Conditioning – Development of strength, agility and flexibility\r\n* Skills – A cross section of skills on all apparatus\r\n* Routines – Skills sequences performed on various apparatus\n\n## Competitions\n\nIncentive class gymnasts have the opportunity to enter “Gym for All” competitions. GFA competitions are held across the region and we actively encourage Incentive class participants to enter.",
