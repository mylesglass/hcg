  "body": "Men's Artistic Gymnastics at HCG offers a well-developed programme for boys. Invitation into our programme is strictly by invitation only, as the demands of competitive gymnastics are not well-suited for every child.\n\n## How can my son get involved?\n\nIf you're interested in competitive gymnastics for your son, it is important that you have a conversation with his coach, so that they know you are interested. \n\nOur MAG coaches look for the following qualities in potential gymnasts:\n\n* High-levels of attendance. The skills that are trained in competitive gymnastics are difficult, and for safety reasons it is important that gymnasts are committed to attending their class.\n* The ability to pause activity and listen to instruction.\n* A certain degree of strength and flexibility.\n* The willingness to repeat skills they have already learnt to improve technique.",
