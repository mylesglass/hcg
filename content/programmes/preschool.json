We spend time playing games to warm up, and learning basic shapes and stretches. You then work and play around a circuit on out equipment with your little one at your own pace.\n\n# 8 Benefits of recreational gymnastics\r\n\nSome of the benefits your preschooler will gain by attending a preschool recreational gymnastics class includes:\r\n\n1. Quality bonding time between a preschooler and their parent.\r\n2. Growth and development with a focus on fundamental movement patterns.\r\n3. Growing essential motor skills.\r\n4. Building confidence, self-esteem and body awareness.\r\n5. Interactive playfulness, improving emotional intelligence.\r\n6. Coordination, strength, flexibility and hand-eye coordination.\r\n7. Social stimulation.\r\n8. Recreational gymnastics is a great fitness foundation, cross training for a variety of sporting and recreation activities as they get older.",
