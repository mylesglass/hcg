  "body": "We believe that gymnastics is a fundamental sport that provides the building blocks for all other sports, and physical activities.\n\nOur Ribbon Award class is for children aged 5 & 6. They will be introduced to new skills and apparatus whilst developing their unique and individual talents through challenging but rewarding circuits, and a progressive award scheme. We want our 5 & 6 year old's to develop into confident movers with strong bones and muscles. Gymnastics will help them to improve their posture, balance, coordination, flexibility, and encourage them to interact with other children. They will also have heaps of fun while doing it.\n\nThis class begins with a warm up activity and basic stretching to make sure the gymnasts are ready to work. We usually then work on circuits as a class, focusing on a variety of areas including swinging, jumping, tumbling, balancing, and heaps of other things. Groups are formed of gymnasts of similar experience, and work closely with a coach to learn new skills.\n\n## Ribbon Award System\n\nOur award system is something we are constantly developing, and confident that it produces well rounded gymnasts. We cover all skills within the gymnast current level during the term, either in circuits or in small groups with coaches.\n\n```\n<span class=\"tag is-primary\"></span>\n```\n\n<span class=\"tag is-primary\"></span>",
