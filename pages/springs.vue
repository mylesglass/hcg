              Spring Floor Fundraiser

              Our spring floor is getting a little bit old, and starting to lose some of it's spring! We're asking our community for help to get the bounce back.

            The floor is one of the most essential pieces of equipment we use in gymnastics. All of our programmes within the gym use the floor. It's a bit on the hard side, and if we can do a bit of renovation to increase the floors spring we'll be able to use it even more! Creating a surface with more rebound will allow our gymnasts to learn more difficult skills - while decreasing the risk of injury through overuse.

                The floor is made up of 1600 springs covered with plywood and foam. The plywood and foam are in great condition - so instead of replacing the whole thing we just need to replace the springs.
                <br/><br/>
                We're thinking that if we can get our extended gymnastics community to help chip in and purchase a spring or two, we'll be able to get the springs shipped here from USA for the summer break, and have a new bouncier floor ready for 2020!

            <h2>Recognition Board</h2>
            <p>
              You may have noticed the fantastic recognition board we've got up on our mezzanine. We're using it as a visual way to recognise who has helped us to achieve this goal. Every spring purchased has a name attached to it - we're hoping to have it full by the end of the year!
              <br><br>
              A huge thanks to Ruth & Scott for all thier hard work with designing, creating, and managing the board!

              Any group, family, or business that purchases a lot of 32 springs - gets a special panel of recognition on our board. You can make it your businesses logo, your family name, or a picture of your dog*
